# Web-Tech-10-hour-exam---terminApp
This is a 10 hour exam from my 3rd semester as a medical computer science student in Web-Technologies.

The task was to create a website with an app for assigning "Termine" (Events) with both administrator and student codes to see either the avaialble dates set by a professor in this example, or see who signed up from the professors side of view.

In total we had a 10 hour timelimit.
